## BRAINSTORMING

### Expansion Phase

- The _brainstorming_ process started with the _expansion_ phase.
- The objective was to come up with a twist on the classic shoot em up genre.
- In this phase, I jotted down almost anything that made enough sense to be put up on paper and made a chart of my ideas.
- It finally came down to looking like this:

## Collection and Collison Phase

- I shortlisted a few final ideas(or themes) from the previous phase.
- Then, I thought of ways in which the themes could be combined to create interesting game ideas.

### Results:

#### **Time-loop/ Inversion/ Space shooter:**

- A game that is played once forward in time and once backwards.
- In the second half, you catch the bullets that you had earlier shot. The bullets glow when they are ready to catch, you need to move to the line of sight such that the enemy is in the path to kill them.
- You end the game where you began.
- (Slightly inspired from the film Tenet and it’s temporal pincer movement)

#### **Thor/ Tower defense/ Ricochet:**

- A game where Thor has to protect the Infinity stones from Thanos and his army.
- A top-down view, Bullet Hell game.
- Thor’s hammer ricochets between enemies.
- As his health decreases, it ricochets off more enemies and deals damage.
- (You could refuse to pick up a health powerup in order to deal more damage)

#### **Thor Platformer/ ability switch:**

- A Thor platformer, ShootEmUp.
  You can throw the hammer to hit long range enemies.
- When you don't have the hammer, you cannot jump high enough. But you deal more close range fist damage(Lightning punches?).
- The idea is to strategically switch between 2 modes based on the situation.
